Step 3: Automate the implementation of a reverse proxy in a new app deployment script (e.g. app_deploy_with_rp.sh)
Add commands to automate the config change
You will need to use the `sed` command
Please write up the steps of how to implement the reverse proxy in the same file as you research (step 1).
