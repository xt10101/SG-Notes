Interview Prep Notes
Not done the task before
Working anywhere is In Lockheed martin?
ask if its similar to anything opther projects
opinion based question


Hi Tom, I wanted make sure I got back to you before the end of the day. Here are my quick thoughts.
 
1. Okay but not sure if Paul can say
2. Would reword this to come from the perspective if "where do you see us going if we do well ob this first contract". Good to mention "if I get the role"
3. Don't aak this, too basic, little value from their side.
4. Okay question, I wonder if you vould get this via research though? Or at least refer to a target you are aware they may have.
5. Not a bad question but not sure Paul will be able to answer. It's the customer that needs DevOps engineers so that might cloud things.
